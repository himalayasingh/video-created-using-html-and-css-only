Video created using HTML and CSS only.

It has "play/pause", "video progress indicator" and "video quality control" functionality.

Whole web application is just a collection of CSS animations played sequentially using the checkbox hack.

The checkbox hack used: A CSS animation is played or paused when a particular checkbox is checked or unchecked.

(Works best in Chrome desktop app, it has some issues in other browsers and also in mobile browsers).
